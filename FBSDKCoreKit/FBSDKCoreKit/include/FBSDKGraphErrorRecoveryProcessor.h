/**
 Defines a type that can process Facebook NSErrors with best practices.

 Facebook NSErrors can contain FBSDKErrorRecoveryAttempting instances to recover from errors, or
 localized messages to present to the user. This class will process the instances as follows:

 1. If the error is temporary as indicated by FBSDKGraphRequestErrorKey, assume the recovery succeeded and
 notify the delegate.
 2. If a FBSDKErrorRecoveryAttempting instance is available, display an alert (dispatched to main thread)
 with the recovery options and call the instance's attemptRecoveryFromError method.
 3. If a FBSDKErrorRecoveryAttempting is not available, check the userInfo for FBSDKLocalizedErrorDescriptionKey
 and present that in an alert (dispatched to main thread).

 By default, FBSDKGraphRequests use this type to process errors and retry the request upon a successful
 recovery.

 Note that Facebook recovery attempters can present UI or even cause app switches (such as to login). Any such
 work is dispatched to the main thread (therefore your request handlers may then run on the main thread).

 Login recovery requires FBSDKLoginKit. Login will prompt the user
 for all permissions last granted. If any are declined on the new request, the recovery is not successful but
 the `[FBSDKAccessToken currentAccessToken]` might still have been updated.
