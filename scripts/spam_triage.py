Spam issue triage for facebook/facebook-ios-sdk.

Deterministic (no LLM). Designed for PRECISION first: a wrongly-closed real bug
is far worse than leaving a spam issue open one more day.

Decision model
--------------
For each OPEN issue we compute:
  * a HARD-HAM veto  -> if any genuine-SDK / maintainer signal is present, never act.
  * a spam score     -> weighted sum of independent spam signals across title+body.

Actions:
  * CLOSE  if a KNOWN scam phone number is present, OR score >= CLOSE_THRESHOLD,
           AND the hard-ham veto did not fire.
  * LABEL  `possible-spam` (no close) if MED <= score < CLOSE_THRESHOLD.
  * SKIP   otherwise, or whenever the veto fires.

Why this is accurate
--------------------
Both observed spam waves embedded a phone number in the body (e.g. 650-543-4800,
+1-844-607-3947) — often obfuscated with unicode / letter-for-digit tricks, and
hidden inside the real bug-report template. Genuine SDK issues contain code,
stack traces, Xcode/SPM details, and version numbers, but ~never a phone number.
So phone-in-body + absence of SDK signals is a very high-precision spam tell, and
the hard-ham veto protects the rare real issue that happens to contain long digit
runs (crash addresses, timestamps) because those carry SDK signals.

Env:
  GH_TOKEN   (required)  token with issues:write  (Actions: ${{ github.token }})
  REPO       (required)  owner/name
  DRY_RUN    "1"/"true"  -> log only, never close/label (default: dry run)
  MAX_CLOSE  int         -> cap closes per run        (default 50)
  MAX_LABEL  int         -> cap labels per run         (default 50)
  TRIPWIRE   int         -> if closeable count exceeds this, ABORT closing and
                           report instead (guards against a bad pattern). default 80
  LOOKBACK_DAYS int      -> only consider issues updated within N days (default 45)
